gif3d
=====

This is a simple application based of https://github.com/wsams/gifverse, a utility for 
making any gif seamless by concatenating a gif and its reversed counterpart.

gif3d takes any image, such as jpg, png, gif, and performs a couple simple distortions and
further animates them for a simple 3d like animated gif.

It's built with basic HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. Animation powered by `imagemagick`.


INSTALL
=======

Install imagemagick if necessary. Easily on a Debian based machine.

    sudo apt-get install imagemagick

Open `index.php` in a browser. Upload a GIF and it's instantly converted into a 3d image.
